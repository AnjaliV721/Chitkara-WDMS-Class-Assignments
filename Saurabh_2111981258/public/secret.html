    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-500 transition duration-300 ease-in-out">When making chocolate desserts, always
        add a little salt. It makes the chocolate flavor more intense.</li>
      <li class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-500 transition duration-300 ease-in-out">Whenever you travel abroad, bring a new
        soundtrack for each place you visit, preferably one you have never heard before. In the future, every time you
        listen to each soundtrack again, they will bring you vivid memories of the places you have visited.</li>
      <li class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-500 transition duration-300 ease-in-out">Do not try to be the person your parents
        would want you to be. Be the person you would like your child to be. It more clearly defines your own
        convictions, desires, goals, and motivates you to be your best.</li>
      <li class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-500 transition duration-300 ease-in-out">If a friend or a family member gets
        diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's, in the early stages try to find out what their favorite songs of all
        time are. In this way, you would be able to create a playlist for them that could be of great benefit in the
        later stages of the disease.</li>
      <li class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-500 transition duration-300 ease-in-out">When a friend is upset, ask them one
        simple question before saying anything else: 'Do you want to talk about it or do you want to be distracted
        from it?'</li>
      <li class="mb-4 hover:text-blue-500 transition duration-300 ease-in-out">If you ever forget your WiFi password or
        you want to get your school WiFi password, etc., just type this command into the command line of a computer
        already connected to that WiFi: netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear</li>
